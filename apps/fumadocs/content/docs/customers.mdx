Echo automatically creates customer records when people message your WhatsApp. Track order history, preferences, and build lasting relationships with your customers.

## How Customers Are Created

Customers are **automatically created** when they first message your business on WhatsApp. You don't need to add them manually.

When a new customer messages:
1. Echo extracts their phone number
2. Creates a customer record
3. Links all their conversations and orders
4. Begins learning their preferences

## Customer List

Navigate to **Customers** from the sidebar to see all your customers. The table shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Customer name (if known) or "Unknown" |
| **Phone** | WhatsApp phone number |
| **Tier** | VIP status based on order history |
| **Orders** | Total number of orders placed |
| **Total Spent** | Lifetime spend with your business |
| **Last Seen** | When they last messaged |

### Sorting Options

Use the **Sort by** dropdown to order customers by:

- **Last Seen** — Most recently active first
- **Total Orders** — Most frequent buyers first
- **Total Spent** — Highest spenders first
- **Date Added** — Newest customers first

### Searching Customers

Type in the search box to find customers by:
- Name
- Phone number (any part of the number works)

## Customer Tiers

Customers are automatically assigned tiers based on their order history:

| Tier | Criteria |
|------|----------|
| **Regular** | New or infrequent customers |
| **Bronze** | 3+ orders OR $50+ spent |
| **Silver** | 10+ orders OR $200+ spent |
| **Gold** | 25+ orders OR $500+ spent |
| **VIP** | 50+ orders OR $1,000+ spent |

Tiers are calculated automatically, but you can manually override them in the customer profile.

### VIP Benefits

- More personalized AI responses

## Adding Customers Manually

While customers are usually created automatically, you can add them manually:

2. Enter their phone number (E.164 format with country code)
3. Optionally enter their name
4. Click **Add Customer**

### Phone Number Format

Phone numbers must be in E.164 format with country code:
- ✅ +1234567890
- ✅ +573001234567 (Colombia)
- ✅ +5511987654321 (Brazil)
- ❌ 1234567890 (missing +)
- ❌ (123) 456-7890 (formatting not allowed)

## Deleting Customers

To delete a customer and their data:

1. Open the customer profile
2. Click **Delete** in the header
3. Confirm the deletion

**What gets deleted:**
- Customer record
- Saved addresses
- Preferences and memories
- Notes

**What gets anonymized (not deleted):**
- Order history (customer ID removed)
- Conversation history (customer ID removed)

This allows you to maintain business records while respecting data deletion requests.

## Data Privacy

Echo supports GDPR and LGPD data deletion requests:

- Customers can request deletion by saying "forget me" or "delete my data"
- The AI confirms and submits the request
- You can approve or deny in the dashboard
- Approved requests anonymize all customer data

See [Settings > Privacy](/settings) for data retention configuration.
