The Conversations dashboard lets you monitor all customer interactions, see what the AI is doing, and take over when needed. Watch conversations in real-time and intervene when human touch is required.

## Conversation List

Navigate to **Conversations** from the sidebar to see all customer conversations. The list shows:

- **Customer** — Phone number or name
- **Status** — Current conversation status
- **Last Message** — Preview of the most recent message
- **Time** — When the last message was sent

### Conversation Statuses

| Status | Description | Indicator |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Active** | AI is handling the conversation | Green |
| **Escalated** | Flagged for human attention | Yellow |
| **Closed** | Conversation has ended | Gray |

### Filtering Conversations

Use the **Status** dropdown to filter by:
- **All** — Show all conversations
- **Active** — Conversations the AI is handling
- **Escalated** — Conversations needing human attention
- **Closed** — Completed conversations

### Searching Conversations

Type in the search box to find conversations by customer phone number or name.

## Conversation Detail View

Click on any conversation to see the full message history and interact with it.

### Message Display

Messages are displayed in a chat-style interface:
- **Customer messages** appear on the left
- **AI responses** appear on the right with an AI indicator
- **Human responses** appear on the right with a person indicator

### Customer Context Panel

When a conversation has a linked customer record, a collapsible panel shows:

- **Customer name and phone**
- **Order history** — Total orders and spend
- **Default address** — For quick reference
- **Allergies** — Prominently displayed in red (safety critical)
- **Restrictions** — Dietary or delivery restrictions
- **Preferences** — Known customer preferences
- **Notes** — Business notes about the customer

Click **View Full Profile** to see the complete customer record.

## Taking Over a Conversation

When you need to handle a conversation personally, click **Take Over**. This:

1. Stops the AI from responding
2. Marks the conversation as "Escalated"
3. Enables the message input so you can reply

### When to Take Over

- Customer is frustrated or confused
- Complex question the AI can't answer
- Sensitive situation requiring human judgment
- Escalation keyword triggered
- Customer explicitly asked for a human

### Sending Messages

After taking over:

1. Type your message in the input field
2. Press Enter or click Send
3. Your message is sent via WhatsApp to the customer

Messages you send are marked with your name in the conversation history.

## Handing Back to AI

When you're done helping, click **Hand Back**. This:

1. Re-enables the AI to respond
2. Changes status back to "Active"
3. AI continues from where you left off

**Tip:** Summarize what you resolved in a message before handing back. The AI can see the conversation history and continue naturally.

## Closing Conversations

Click **Close** to end a conversation. Closed conversations:

- Stop receiving AI responses
- Are marked as completed
- Can be reopened later if the customer messages again

### When to Close

- Customer's issue is fully resolved
- Order is complete and delivered
- Customer explicitly says goodbye
- No response after extended period

### Reopening Conversations

Click **Reopen** on a closed conversation to:
- Resume the conversation
- Re-enable AI responses
- Mark as active again

## Escalation

Conversations can be escalated automatically or manually:

### Automatic Escalation

The AI escalates when:
- Customer uses an escalation keyword (configured in Settings)
- AI is uncertain how to respond
- Customer expresses frustration
- Request is outside AI capabilities

### Escalation Keywords

Configure escalation keywords in **Settings > AI & Automation > Escalation Rules**. Common examples:

- "human"
- "agent"
- "manager"
- "help me"
- "not working"

When a customer uses these phrases, the conversation is automatically escalated.

### Handling Escalated Conversations

1. Filter by "Escalated" status to see pending escalations
2. Review the conversation history
3. Take Over and respond to the customer
4. Resolve the issue
5. Hand Back or Close as appropriate

## Best Practices

### Monitor Regularly
Check escalated conversations frequently. Customers waiting for human help expect quick responses.

### Review AI Responses
Occasionally review active conversations to ensure the AI is responding appropriately.

### Use Customer Context
Check the customer panel before responding. Knowing their order history and preferences helps personalize your response.

### Document Resolutions
Add notes to customer profiles after resolving complex issues. This helps the AI and future human agents.

### Train Your AI
If the AI frequently struggles with certain questions, update your product descriptions or AI personality instructions.
