If you already sell on Shopify, you can import your product catalog directly into Echo. This saves time and keeps your inventory in sync.

## Benefits

- **Automatic Import** — Import all products with one click
- **Variant Support** — Each Shopify variant becomes a separate Echo product
- **Inventory Sync** — Keep availability in sync with Shopify
- **Payment Integration** — Customers can pay via Shopify checkout

## Connecting Shopify

<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

### Navigate to Shopify Settings

Go to **Settings > Integrations > Shopify** in Echo.

### Enter Your Store URL

Enter your Shopify store URL:
- Use the format: `your-store.myshopify.com`
- Don't include `https://` or trailing slashes

### Authorize the Connection

1. Click **Connect Shopify**
2. You'll be redirected to Shopify
3. Review the permissions Echo is requesting
4. Click **Install app** to authorize

You'll be redirected back to Echo with a success message.

### Import Your Products

After connecting, click **Import Products** to bring your catalog into Echo:

- All active products are imported
- Draft and archived products are skipped
- Each variant becomes a separate product
- Prices are converted to your business currency

The import shows:
- Number of products imported
- Number of products skipped
- Any errors that occurred

## Product Import Details

### What Gets Imported

| Shopify Field | Echo Field |
|---------------|------------|
| Product Title | Name |
| Description (HTML stripped) | Description |
| Variant Price | Price |
| Variant Title | Added to product name |
| Product Images | Image (first image) |
| Inventory | Availability |

### Handling Variants

Shopify products with variants (size, color, etc.) become multiple Echo products:

- **Shopify:** "T-Shirt" with Small, Medium, Large variants
- **Echo:** "T-Shirt - Small", "T-Shirt - Medium", "T-Shirt - Large"

Each variant has its own price and availability in Echo.

### Out of Stock Products

Products with zero inventory are imported but marked as **unavailable**. The AI won't suggest them to customers.

## Syncing Products

After the initial import, you can sync to pull in changes:

1. Click **Sync Products**
2. Echo fetches the latest data from Shopify
3. Products are updated, added, or removed as needed

### Sync Results

The sync shows:
- **Updated** — Products with changed data
- **Added** — New products in Shopify
- **Removed** — Products deleted from Shopify

### When to Sync

Sync manually after:
- Adding new products in Shopify
- Changing prices
- Updating descriptions
- Archiving products

**Note:** Automatic sync is not yet available. Run sync manually when needed.

## Order Integration

When Shopify is connected, payment links use Shopify Checkout instead of Stripe:

1. Customer confirms order via WhatsApp
2. AI generates a Shopify checkout link
3. Customer completes payment on Shopify
4. Order appears in both Echo and Shopify

Orders paid through Shopify show:
- **Payment Provider:** Shopify
- **Shopify Order Number:** e.g., #1001
- **View in Shopify:** Link to the order in Shopify Admin

## Disconnecting Shopify

To disconnect your Shopify store:

1. Go to **Settings > Integrations > Shopify**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the disconnection

### What Happens After Disconnect

- **Products remain** — Products stay in Echo but won't sync
- **Orders remain** — Existing orders are not affected
- **New payments** — Will use Stripe (if configured) or cash

Products imported from Shopify can still be edited manually in Echo.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed

1. **Check your store URL** — Must be `store.myshopify.com` format
2. **Browser popups** — Allow popups for the authorization redirect
3. **Try again** — Sometimes OAuth flows timeout

### Import Shows Errors

1. **Invalid products** — Products without titles are skipped
2. **Missing prices** — Variants without prices are skipped
3. **Rate limits** — If you have many products, wait and try again

### Products Not Syncing

1. Make sure you're connected (check status shows "Connected")
2. Click **Sync Products** to manually trigger sync
3. Check for errors in the sync result

### Payment Links Not Working

1. Verify Shopify is connected
2. Check that you have payment methods enabled in Shopify
3. Test checkout with a small order

## Best Practices

### Keep Shopify as Source of Truth
Make product changes in Shopify and sync to Echo, rather than editing in both places.

### Sync After Major Changes
After adding many products or changing prices, run a sync to keep Echo current.

### Test Before Going Live
Place a test order through the full flow to ensure Shopify checkout works correctly.
