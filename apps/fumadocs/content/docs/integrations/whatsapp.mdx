Connect your WhatsApp Business number to Echo using Twilio. This allows customers to message your business and receive AI-powered responses.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up, you'll need:

1. A [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) (free trial available)
2. A WhatsApp-enabled Twilio phone number or [WhatsApp Sandbox](https://www.twilio.com/docs/whatsapp/sandbox)
3. Your Twilio Account SID and Auth Token

## Setup Steps

<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

### Create a Twilio Account

1. Go to [Twilio's website](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email and phone number

### Set Up WhatsApp Sandbox (Development)

For testing, use Twilio's WhatsApp Sandbox:

1. In Twilio Console, go to **Messaging > Try it out > Send a WhatsApp message**
2. Follow the instructions to join your sandbox
3. Note your sandbox phone number

For production, you'll need to [apply for a WhatsApp Business number](https://www.twilio.com/docs/whatsapp/api#requesting-access-for-your-own-number).

### Get Your Twilio Credentials

1. Go to your [Twilio Console Dashboard](https://console.twilio.com/)
2. Find your **Account SID** and **Auth Token**
3. Copy these values — you'll need them in the next step

### Configure Echo

1. In Echo, go to **Settings > Integrations > WhatsApp**
2. Enter your credentials:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Account SID** | Your Twilio Account SID (starts with "AC") |
| **Auth Token** | Your Twilio Auth Token |
| **Phone Number** | Your WhatsApp number in E.164 format (e.g., +14155551234) |

3. Click **Save Credentials**

### Configure the Webhook URL

This is the most important step. Twilio needs to know where to send incoming messages.

1. In Echo's WhatsApp settings, find the **Webhook URL**
2. Copy the URL (looks like `https://your-deployment.convex.site/webhook/whatsapp`)
3. In Twilio Console:
   - For Sandbox: Go to **Messaging > Settings > WhatsApp Sandbox settings**
   - For Production: Go to your WhatsApp Sender configuration
4. Paste the webhook URL in the **"When a message comes in"** field
5. Make sure the method is set to **POST**
6. Save your changes

### Test the Connection

1. Click **Test Connection** in Echo
2. If successful, you'll see a green checkmark
3. Send a test message from your phone to your WhatsApp number
4. Check the Conversations dashboard — you should see the message

## Connection Status

The WhatsApp settings page shows your current connection status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Connected & Verified** | Everything is working correctly |
| **Connected** | Credentials saved but not verified |
| **Not Connected** | No credentials configured |

**Last Webhook** shows when Echo last received a message from Twilio, confirming the webhook is working.

## Troubleshooting

### Messages Not Arriving

1. **Check webhook URL** — Make sure it's correctly configured in Twilio
2. **Verify the URL is accessible** — Test by visiting the URL in your browser (should show an error, not a 404)
3. **Check Twilio logs** — Go to Twilio Console > Monitor > Logs > Webhooks for error details

### "Account SID or Auth Token invalid"

1. Double-check your credentials in Twilio Console
2. Make sure you're using the Account SID, not the API Key SID
3. Auth Token changes if you reset it — copy the new one

### Messages Delayed

WhatsApp has [rate limits](https://www.twilio.com/docs/whatsapp/rate-limits). If you're sending many messages:
- Messages may be queued
- Consider upgrading your Twilio plan

### Sandbox Expired

Twilio Sandbox connections expire after 72 hours of inactivity. To reconnect:
1. Send the join message again from your phone
2. Continue testing

For production use, get a WhatsApp Business number.

## Production Setup

For a production WhatsApp Business account:

1. [Apply for WhatsApp Business API access](https://www.twilio.com/docs/whatsapp/api#requesting-access-for-your-own-number)
2. Verify your business with Facebook/Meta
3. Wait for approval (typically 1-2 weeks)
4. Configure your production number in Twilio
5. Update Echo with your production phone number

## Best Practices

### Use a Dedicated Number
Don't use a personal WhatsApp number. Get a business line for professional communication.

### Set Up During Business Hours
Do initial testing when you can respond to test messages quickly.

### Monitor Regularly
Check the connection status periodically to ensure messages are flowing.
