## Required Integration

### WhatsApp

WhatsApp is **required** for Echo to function. Without it, you can't receive customer messages.

[Set up WhatsApp →](/integrations/whatsapp)

## Optional Integrations

### Shopify

If you already have a Shopify store, you can import your products instead of adding them manually. This saves time and keeps your catalog in sync.

[Set up Shopify →](/integrations/shopify)

## Future Integrations

We're working on additional integrations:

- **Stripe** — Direct payment processing
- **WooCommerce** — Product catalog sync
- **Square** — POS integration
