Your product catalog is central to Echo. The AI uses your products to answer customer questions about pricing, availability, and to help customers place orders.

## Viewing Products

Navigate to **Products** from the sidebar to see your full catalog. You can switch between two views:

- **Grid View** — Visual cards showing product images, names, and prices
- **Table View** — Compact list with more products visible at once

Toggle between views using the icons in the top-right corner.

## Searching and Filtering

### Search

Type in the search box to find products by name or description. Results filter as you type.

### Category Filter

Use the **Category** dropdown to show only products in a specific category, or select **Uncategorized** to find products without a category.

### Availability Filter

Use the **Availability** dropdown to filter by:

- **All Products** — Show everything
- **Available Only** — Products currently in stock
- **Unavailable Only** — Products marked as out of stock

## Adding a New Product

Click **Add Product** to create a new product. Fill in the following fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Product Name** | Yes | The name customers will see when ordering |
| **Description** | No | Details about the product (ingredients, size, etc.) |
| **Price** | Yes | Product price in your business currency |
| **Category** | No | Group products for easier organization |
| **Product Image** | No | Photo of the product (upload from your device) |

After saving, the product is immediately available for customers to order.

### Creating Categories Inline

While adding a product, you can create a new category by clicking the **+** button next to the category dropdown. Enter the category name and it will be created and selected automatically.

## Editing Products

Click on any product to open its detail page. Here you can:

- Update the name, description, and price
- Change the category
- Upload a new image
- Toggle availability

Click **Save Changes** when done.

## Deleting Products

From the product detail page, click **Delete** to remove a product. This action cannot be undone.

**Note:** Deleting a product does not affect past orders that included it.

## Product Availability

Each product has an availability toggle that controls whether customers can order it:

- **Available** — Product can be ordered and appears in AI responses
- **Unavailable** — Product is hidden from customers and cannot be ordered

Use this feature for:
- Temporarily out-of-stock items
- Seasonal products
- Items you're discontinuing

The AI will not suggest unavailable products to customers.

## Bulk Operations

Select multiple products to perform bulk actions. Click the checkbox on each product card or use the table view's "Select All" option.

When products are selected, a toolbar appears at the bottom with these actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mark Available** | Set all selected products as available |
| **Mark Unavailable** | Set all selected products as unavailable |
| **Delete** | Delete all selected products (with confirmation) |
| **Move to...** | Change the category for all selected products |

### Example: Seasonal Menu Update

1. Filter by category (e.g., "Summer Drinks")
2. Select all products in that category
3. Click **Mark Unavailable** to hide them all at once
4. Later, select and **Mark Available** when the season returns

## Shopify Product Import

If you use Shopify, you can import your entire product catalog automatically. See [Shopify Integration](/integrations/shopify) for setup instructions.

Imported products are linked to Shopify and will sync availability when configured.

## Best Practices

### Clear Product Names
Use names customers would naturally say. "Large Coffee" is better than "BVRG-LG-001".

### Helpful Descriptions
Include details the AI can use to answer questions:
- Ingredients and allergens
- Size/weight
- Preparation time

### Consistent Pricing
Store prices include all fees. The price shown is what customers pay.

### Organized Categories
Group related products so customers can browse. Categories like "Appetizers", "Main Dishes", "Desserts" help both customers and the AI.
