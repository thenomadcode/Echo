Categories help you organize your products into logical groups. Customers can browse by category, and the AI uses categories to suggest related items.

## Why Use Categories?

- **Organization** — Group related products together (e.g., "Appetizers", "Main Dishes", "Desserts")
- **AI Context** — The AI understands product groupings and can suggest alternatives from the same category
- **Filtering** — Quickly find products using the category filter on the Products page
- **Bulk Actions** — Move multiple products to a category at once

## Managing Categories

Navigate to **Products → Manage Categories** to open the category manager.

### Creating a Category

1. Enter the category name in the text field
2. Click **Create Category**

The category is immediately available for assigning products.

### Editing a Category

1. Click the pencil icon next to the category name
2. Update the name
3. Click **Save** (or Cancel to discard changes)

Renaming a category does not affect the products assigned to it.

### Deleting a Category

1. Click the trash icon next to the category
2. Confirm the deletion

**Important:** When you delete a category, products in that category become **uncategorized**. The products themselves are not deleted.

## Uncategorized Products

Products without a category are grouped under "Uncategorized" in the category manager. The count shows how many products have no category assigned.

To assign uncategorized products to a category:

1. Go to **Products**
2. Filter by **Uncategorized**
3. Select the products you want to move
4. Use the **Move to...** dropdown in the bulk action toolbar

## Moving Products Between Categories

You can change a product's category in two ways:

### Single Product
1. Click on the product to open its detail page
2. Select a new category from the dropdown
3. Save changes

### Multiple Products (Bulk)
1. Go to **Products**
2. Select the products you want to move
3. Click **Move to...** in the bulk action toolbar
4. Select the destination category

Products are moved immediately.

## Category Best Practices

### Use Clear Names
Choose names your customers would use. "Pizza" is clearer than "Italian Entrees - Flatbread".

### Keep It Simple
Start with 3-5 main categories. You can always add more later.

### Match Your Business
- **Restaurant:** Appetizers, Main Dishes, Desserts, Drinks
- **Pharmacy:** Medications, Personal Care, Vitamins, First Aid
- **Retail:** Men's, Women's, Kids, Accessories

### Avoid Empty Categories
If a category has no products, consider removing it to keep the list clean.
