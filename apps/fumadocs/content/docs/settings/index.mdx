## Business Info

Update your business profile:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Business Name** | Your business name shown to customers |
| **Description** | Brief description for AI context |
| **Logo URL** | URL to your logo image |

Changes are saved when you click **Save Changes**.

## Localization

Set your business locale:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Default Language** | Primary language for AI responses (English, Spanish, Portuguese) |
| **Timezone** | Your business timezone for scheduling and timestamps |

**Note:** The AI auto-detects customer language and responds in their language, but uses your default language for new conversations.

## Business Hours

Configure when your business operates:

1. Check the days you're open
2. Set opening and closing times for each day
3. Click **Save Changes**

Outside business hours:
- AI continues to respond
- Optionally, AI can mention when you'll be available

## Privacy & Data Retention

Configure how long customer data is kept:

| Retention Period | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Never delete** | Keep all data indefinitely |
| **30 days** | Anonymize data after 30 days |
| **60 days** | Anonymize data after 60 days |
| **90 days** | Anonymize data after 90 days |
| **180 days** | Anonymize data after 180 days |
| **365 days** | Anonymize data after 365 days |

When data is anonymized:
- Customer name and phone are replaced
- Order history is kept but de-identified
- Conversations are kept but de-identified
- Allergies and preferences are deleted

Customers receive a 7-day warning before anonymization.

## Navigation

Settings uses a sidebar navigation on desktop. On mobile, sections appear vertically.

Click any setting group in the sidebar to jump to that section. Changes are saved per-section when you click the save button.
