Echo's AI is customizable to match your business personality. Configure how it greets customers, its communication style, and when to escalate to humans.

## How the AI Works

Echo's AI:

1. **Receives** customer messages via WhatsApp
2. **Understands** intent (product question, order request, complaint, etc.)
3. **Retrieves** relevant product information
4. **Responds** in the customer's language with your business personality
5. **Escalates** when it can't help or detects frustration

The AI has access to:
- Your product catalog (names, descriptions, prices, availability)
- Customer history (past orders, preferences, allergies)
- Your business information (name, description, hours)
- Conversation context (what's been discussed)

## Greeting Message

The first message customers receive sets the tone. Configure it in **Settings > AI & Automation > AI Personality**.

### Good Greeting Examples

```
Hello! Welcome to [Business Name]. I'm here to help you with our menu and orders. What can I get for you today?
```

```
Hi there! Thanks for reaching out to [Business Name]. I can help you browse our products, place an order, or answer questions. How can I help?
```

### Tips for Greetings

- Keep it warm but concise (1-2 sentences)
- Mention what you can help with
- Avoid being too formal or too casual
- Don't use ALL CAPS or excessive emojis

## Personality Instructions

Guide the AI's tone and behavior with custom instructions. These shape how the AI responds throughout the conversation.

### Example Instructions

```
Be friendly and casual, like talking to a neighbor. Use the customer's name when you know it. Keep responses concise - customers are busy. If asked about ingredients or allergies, take it seriously and be thorough.
```

```
Be professional and helpful. Answer questions directly. When suggesting products, explain why they're a good fit. If you don't know something, say so honestly rather than making things up.
```

### What to Include

| Topic | Example Instruction |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Tone** | "Be friendly and casual" or "Be professional" |
| **Length** | "Keep responses under 3 sentences when possible" |
| **Upselling** | "Suggest add-ons when relevant, but don't push" |
| **Uncertainty** | "If unsure, offer to connect with a human" |
| **Allergies** | "Take allergy questions very seriously" |

### What to Avoid

- Overly complex instructions
- Contradicting instructions
- Instructions about things outside the AI's knowledge
- Instructions that violate WhatsApp policies

## Escalation Keywords

Configure words and phrases that automatically escalate to a human. Go to **Settings > AI & Automation > Escalation Rules**.

### Default Escalation Keywords

- "human"
- "agent"
- "manager"
- "speak to someone"
- "real person"

### Adding Custom Keywords

Add keywords relevant to your business:

| Business Type | Suggested Keywords |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Restaurant | "refund", "wrong order", "sick" |
| Pharmacy | "prescription", "doctor", "emergency" |
| Retail | "return", "defective", "damaged" |

### How Escalation Works

When a customer uses an escalation keyword:

1. Conversation is marked as "Escalated"
2. You receive a notification (if configured)
3. AI stops responding automatically
4. Customer sees a message that a human will help soon

## Language Detection

The AI automatically detects the customer's language from their first message and responds in that language.

### Supported Languages

| Language | ISO Code |
|----------|----------|
| English | en |
| Spanish | es |
| Portuguese | pt |

If the AI can't detect the language, it uses your **Default Language** setting.

## Tips for Effective AI Configuration

### Start Simple
Begin with minimal instructions and add more as you notice issues.

### Test Regularly
Send test messages to your WhatsApp number to check how the AI responds.

### Review Conversations
Check the Conversations dashboard to see how customers interact with the AI.

### Iterate
Adjust greeting, instructions, and escalation keywords based on real conversations.

### Don't Over-Engineer
The AI is already trained to be helpful. Your instructions fine-tune behavior, not teach basics.

## Common Adjustments

### AI is Too Formal
Add: "Be casual and friendly. Use contractions like "I'm" and "we'll"."

### AI is Too Wordy
Add: "Keep responses concise. Use 1-3 sentences when possible."

### AI Pushes Sales Too Hard
Add: "Only suggest products when directly relevant. Don't push sales."

### AI Doesn't Know When to Stop
Add: "If you've answered the question, don't add unnecessary follow-ups."

### AI Handles Complaints Poorly
Add: "For complaints, always apologize and offer to connect with a human."
