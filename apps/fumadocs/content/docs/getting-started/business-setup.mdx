When you first sign in to Echo, you'll be guided through a 3-step onboarding wizard to set up your business profile. This information helps the AI understand your business and respond appropriately to customers.

## The Onboarding Wizard

<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

### Step 1: Business Information

Enter the core details about your business:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Business Name** | Yes | Your business name (minimum 2 characters). This is shown to customers and used by the AI. |
| **Business Type** | Yes | Select the category that best describes your business. |
| **Description** | No | A brief description of your business. Helps the AI understand what you sell or do. |

### Step 2: Branding

Customize your business appearance:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Business Logo** | No | A URL to your logo image. Displayed in the dashboard and can be shown to customers. |
| **Business Address** | No | Your physical address. Shown to customers for pickup orders. |

To add a logo, enter the URL of an image hosted online (e.g., `https://example.com/logo.png`). The image will be previewed as you type.

### Step 3: Review & Create

Review all your information before creating your business:

- Your logo and name are displayed
- Business type is shown
- Description and address are listed (if provided)

You have two options:
- **Create Business & Go to Dashboard** — Start using Echo immediately
- **Create & Connect WhatsApp** — Create and go directly to WhatsApp integration settings

## Business Types

Echo supports four business types, each optimized for different use cases:

| Type | Best For | AI Behavior |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Restaurant** | Cafes, restaurants, food delivery | Understands menu items, dietary restrictions, delivery times |
| **Pharmacy** | Pharmacies, drugstores | Careful with medical queries, emphasizes consulting professionals |
| **Retail** | Shops, stores, e-commerce | Product availability, sizing, shipping questions |
| **Other** | Any other business | General-purpose customer service responses |

The AI uses your business type to tailor its responses. For example, a restaurant AI will naturally handle questions about ingredients and allergens, while a retail AI focuses on product details and stock.

## Editing Your Business Later

After creating your business, you can update all settings from **Settings > General > Business Info**:

- Change your business name
- Update the description
- Modify your logo URL
- Edit your address

3. Complete the onboarding wizard again

Each business has its own:
- Product catalog
- WhatsApp connection
- Customer conversations
- Order history

Switch between businesses using the business selector in the sidebar.
