### Set up your business profile

Complete the onboarding wizard to configure your business:

1. **Business Info** — Enter your business name, type (restaurant, pharmacy, retail, or other), and description

- Or import products from Shopify if you have an existing store

### Configure your AI assistant

Customize how the AI interacts with your customers:

### Test your setup

Before going live, send a few test messages to your WhatsApp number:

1. Ask about a product from your catalog
2. Try placing a test order
3. Use an escalation keyword to verify handover works
4. Check the Conversations dashboard to see the interaction

### Go live!

Once testing is complete, you're ready to share your WhatsApp number with customers. The AI will handle incoming messages 24/7, and you can monitor conversations from the dashboard.
