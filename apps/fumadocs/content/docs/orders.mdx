When customers place orders through WhatsApp, they appear in the Orders dashboard. Track orders from creation to delivery, update their status, and manage fulfillment.

## Order Lifecycle

Orders follow a specific lifecycle from creation to completion:

```
Draft → Confirmed → Paid → Preparing → Ready → Delivered
                                             ↓
                                        (Cancelled)
```

### Order Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Order created but not yet confirmed by customer |
| **Confirmed** | Customer confirmed the order, awaiting payment |
| **Paid** | Payment received (card or cash marked as paid) |
| **Preparing** | Order is being prepared |
| **Ready** | Order is ready for pickup or delivery |
| **Delivered** | Order has been delivered to customer |
| **Cancelled** | Order was cancelled |

## Viewing Orders

Navigate to **Orders** from the sidebar to see all orders. The list shows:

- **Order Number** — Unique identifier (e.g., ORD-001)
- **Status** — Current order status with color-coded badge
- **Items** — Number of items in the order
- **Total** — Order total in your business currency
- **Date** — When the order was placed

### Filtering Orders

Use the **Status** dropdown to filter orders by their current status. This helps you quickly find:

- Orders waiting for payment (Confirmed)
- Orders to prepare (Paid)
- Orders ready for pickup (Ready)

### Searching Orders

Type in the search box to find orders by:

- Order number
- Customer phone number

## Order Detail View

Click on any order to see its full details:

### Order Items

- Product name
- Quantity ordered
- Unit price
- Line total

### Customer Information
- Customer name (if provided)
- Phone number
- Delivery address (for delivery orders)
- Delivery notes (special instructions)

### Payment Information

### Order Timeline

## Fulfillment Actions

When viewing an order, you can update its status using the action buttons:

### Mark as Preparing
Available when: Order is **Paid**

Click when you start preparing the order. This helps track which orders are in progress.

### Mark as Ready
Available when: Order is **Preparing**

Click when the order is ready for pickup or delivery. If the customer has WhatsApp notifications enabled, they'll be notified.

### Mark as Delivered
Available when: Order is **Ready**

Click when the order has been picked up or delivered to the customer. This completes the order lifecycle.

## Cancelling Orders

You can cancel an order at any stage except after delivery.

1. Open the order detail page
2. Click **Cancel Order**
3. Confirm the cancellation

**Note:** For card payments, cancellation doesn't automatically refund. You'll need to process refunds through your payment provider (Stripe or Shopify).

## Payment Methods

Orders support two payment methods:

### Card Payment
Customer pays online via Stripe or Shopify checkout:
- AI generates a payment link
- Customer clicks to pay
- Order automatically moves to "Paid" status

### Cash Payment
Customer pays on delivery or pickup:
- Order moves to "Confirmed" status
- Mark as "Paid" manually after receiving cash

## Delivery Types

### Delivery
Order is delivered to customer's address. The order includes:
- Delivery address
- Optional delivery notes
- Delivery fee (if configured)

### Pickup
Customer picks up the order at your location. No delivery address is required.

## Shopify Integration

If you use Shopify, orders placed through Echo can be synced to your Shopify store:

- Orders appear in your Shopify Admin
- Inventory is updated automatically
- Payment flows through Shopify Checkout

A "View in Shopify" link appears on orders paid through Shopify.

See [Shopify Integration](/integrations/shopify) for setup details.

## Best Practices

### Regular Status Updates
Keep order statuses current. Customers with WhatsApp notifications rely on accurate status updates.

### Check for Special Instructions
Always read delivery notes before preparing an order. Customers may include allergy information or special requests.

### Handle Cancellations Promptly
If you need to cancel an order (out of stock, can't deliver to area), do it quickly so customers can reorder elsewhere.
