## Codebase Patterns
- Schema tables use `defineTable()` with `v` validators from "convex/values"
- Fumadocs: meta.json in each folder defines navigation order via `pages` array
- Fumadocs: Page frontmatter includes title, description, icon (Lucide icon name)
- Fumadocs: URL structure is /docs/{slug} where slug matches folder/file structure
- TailwindCSS 4: custom fonts defined in `@theme inline` block with `--font-*` variables
- Google Fonts: use preconnect hints + `display=swap` for optimal loading
- Auth pattern: `authComponent.safeGetAuthUser(ctx)` returns authUser with `userId` property - always check `!authUser || !authUser.userId`
- After auth check, store userId in const: `const userId = authUser.userId;` to avoid TypeScript narrowing issues
- Owner references use `ownerId: v.string()` (not v.id) since authUser.userId is a string
- Timestamps stored as `v.number()` in UTC, populated with `Date.now()` in mutations
- Optional fields use `v.optional(v.type)` wrapper
- Enum-like fields use `v.union(v.literal("value1"), v.literal("value2"))`
- Indexes defined with `.index("indexName", ["field"])` chained after defineTable
- Nested objects use `v.object({ field: v.type })`
- Mutations use `Record<string, unknown>` for update objects to avoid optional field type conflicts
- Uniqueness validation: query by index in loop, append suffix if exists
- Queries return null/empty arrays for unauthorized access; mutations throw errors
- Lib utilities: create under `convex/lib/` using `GenericDatabaseReader<DataModel>` for db access
- Dashboard conversation status: active | escalated | closed (separate from AI state machine)
- Human assignment: assignedTo field with v.string() (user ID from better-auth), null/undefined means AI handling
- TanStack Router layout routes: `_authenticated.tsx` creates pathless layout, child routes go in `_authenticated/` folder
- Base UI AlertDialog: does NOT support asChild prop - use controlled open state instead of AlertDialogTrigger
- Sidebar context pattern: use SidebarContext + SidebarProvider for shared collapsed state between Sidebar and layout
- Sidebar collapsible animation: use `transition-[width] duration-200` for smooth width changes
- Content area responds to sidebar state: use `transition-[padding-left]` to animate content offset
- Fumadocs Steps: use `<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">` with h3 headings for numbered steps (no import needed)

## 2026-01-22 10:10 - S08: Handle Variants in Chat

**What was implemented:**
- Updated AI prompt system to detect and handle product variants
- Added shopifyProductId to Product interfaces in agentPrompt.ts, prompts.ts, response.ts
- Created variant grouping functions:
  - getBaseProductName(): Extracts base name from "Product - Variant" format
  - getVariantName(): Extracts variant name
  - groupProductsByVariant(): Groups products by shopifyProductId
  - formatProductCatalog/formatProductCatalogWithVariants(): Formats catalog with variant grouping
- Products with same shopifyProductId are grouped and displayed as:
  ```
  - Blue Hoodie (HAS VARIANTS - ask customer which they want):
      • Small: $25.00
      • Medium: $25.00
      • Large: $25.00 [OUT OF STOCK]
  ```
- Added variant handling instructions to both AI prompts:
  - Always ask which variant before adding to order
  - Use full product name (e.g., "Hoodie - Medium")
  - Handle out-of-stock variants gracefully
- Updated agent.ts and process.ts to pass shopifyProductId to AI context

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/ai/agentPrompt.ts (added variant grouping and instructions)
- packages/backend/convex/ai/prompts.ts (added variant grouping and instructions)
- packages/backend/convex/ai/response.ts (added shopifyProductId to validator)
- packages/backend/convex/ai/agent.ts (pass shopifyProductId)
- packages/backend/convex/ai/process.ts (pass shopifyProductId)

**Verification:**
- LSP diagnostics: no errors
- web tsc --noEmit: passes

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Shopify variants become separate Echo products with names "Product - Variant"
- Products with same shopifyProductId are variants of same Shopify product
- AI instructions for variant handling must be explicit: always ask, use full name
- Out-of-stock variants should be shown but marked, so AI can suggest alternatives

---

## 2026-01-22 09:57 - S07: Payment Method Routing

**What was implemented:**
- Payment method routing was already implemented in generatePaymentLink action:
  - Checks for Shopify connection first (uses Shopify Draft Orders)
  - Falls back to Stripe Checkout if no Shopify
  - Throws error if neither configured: "No payment provider configured. Please connect Shopify or set up Stripe."
- Added paymentProvider: "cash" assignment in setPaymentMethod mutation for cash orders
- Schema already had paymentProvider field: 'stripe' | 'shopify' | 'cash'

**Payment flow:**
1. Cash: setPaymentMethod sets paymentMethod="cash", status="confirmed", paymentProvider="cash"
2. Card with Shopify: generatePaymentLink -> shopify.createOrder -> sets paymentProvider="shopify"
3. Card with Stripe: generatePaymentLink -> Stripe API -> sets paymentProvider="stripe"
4. Card with neither: generatePaymentLink throws error, AI suggests cash payment

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/orders.ts (added paymentProvider="cash" in setPaymentMethod)

**Verification:**
- LSP diagnostics: no errors
- web tsc --noEmit: passes

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- generatePaymentLink already implements provider routing pattern: check specialized first, then generic
- AI response generator handles missing payment link by suggesting cash: "Apologize and suggest they try again or choose cash payment"
- Cash on delivery always works - just sets status to "confirmed" without needing any external provider

---

## 2026-01-22 09:50 - S06: Handle Shopify Payment Completion

**What was implemented:**
- Added "orders/paid" to WEBHOOK_TOPICS array to register on Shopify connection
- Added by_shopify_draft_order index to orders table for efficient lookup
- Created getOrderByShopifyDraftOrderId internal query to find Echo order by draft order ID
- Created updateOrderFromShopifyPayment internal mutation to update order status
- Added orders/paid case in handleWebhook to process payment completion webhook:
  - Finds Echo order by shopifyDraftOrderId from webhook payload
  - Updates order status to "paid" and paymentStatus to "paid"
  - Stores shopifyOrderId and shopifyOrderNumber on Echo order
  - Handles partial payments gracefully (keeps status as pending)
- Created sendPaymentConfirmation internal action to send WhatsApp message
- Created saveAiMessage and getConversationForConfirmation helpers

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/shopify.ts (added webhook topic, query, mutations, action, handleWebhook case)
- packages/backend/convex/schema.ts (added by_shopify_draft_order index)

**Verification:**
- LSP diagnostics: no errors
- bunx tsc --noEmit: passes (backend type errors are pre-existing node types issue)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Shopify orders/paid webhook includes draft_order_id field if order was created from draft
- Shopify REST webhook formats differ from GraphQL (snake_case vs camelCase)
- WhatsApp confirmation sent via api.integrations.whatsapp.actions.sendMessage
- Pattern: store draft order ID, then update with real order ID when payment completes

---

## 2026-01-21 23:15 - S02: Initial Product Import

**What was implemented:**
- S02 was already fully implemented in the backend (shopify.importProducts action)
- Backend implementation includes:
  - Paginated GraphQL queries via SHOPIFY_PRODUCTS_QUERY (handles 1000+ products)
  - Skips non-ACTIVE products (draft and archived)
  - Each Shopify variant becomes a separate Echo product with shopifyVariantId
  - Products marked with source: "shopify"
  - upsertProduct mutation handles create/update logic
  - Returns { imported, skipped, errors } for summary
- Frontend already had Import Products button with loading spinner
- Only fix needed: Updated toast message format from "Imported X products successfully!" to "Imported X products, skipped Y" to match PRD acceptance criteria

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/routes/_authenticated/settings_.integrations_.shopify.tsx (toast message format)

**Verification:**
- bunx tsc --noEmit: passes
- LSP diagnostics: no errors

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Shopify GraphQL API uses cursor-based pagination with pageInfo.hasNextPage and endCursor
- Shopify product status is uppercase in GraphQL response ("ACTIVE", not "active")
- Shopify variant IDs in GraphQL are GID format: gid://shopify/ProductVariant/123456
- Price comes as string in dollars, needs conversion to cents for storage

## 2026-01-20 22:10 - S07: Create send message as human mutation

**What was implemented:**
- Created packages/backend/convex/messages.ts with sendAsHuman mutation
- Validates conversation exists and is assigned to current user
- Saves message to messages table with sender: "human"
- Uses ctx.scheduler.runAfter to trigger async WhatsApp send
- Created sendToWhatsApp internalMutation for Twilio API integration
- Handles failures gracefully: stores deliveryStatus "failed" with errorMessage
- On success: stores externalId (Twilio SID) and deliveryStatus "sent"

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/messages.ts (created, 115 lines)

**Learnings:**
- Use ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, ...) for async operations to avoid blocking mutation
- internalMutation can do external API calls (fetch) in Convex
- Store both success and failure states in message for UI feedback

**Verification:**
- Convex dev compiles successfully
- LSP diagnostics: no errors
- bun run check-types: passes
- Committed as: feat: S07 - Create send message as human mutation (commit 89ad42c)

---

- If status was 'escalated', changes to 'active'
- Validates auth and business ownership
- Created conversations.handBack mutation
- Sets assignedTo to undefined (AI resumes handling)
- Validates conversation is currently assigned to this user
- Both mutations return the updated conversation
- Fixed schema: changed assignedTo and userId from v.id("users") to v.string() since better-auth user table is managed by component

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/conversations.ts (+55 lines)
- packages/backend/convex/schema.ts (changed v.id("users") to v.string() for assignedTo and notifications.userId)

**Learnings:**
- better-auth creates a "user" table managed by its component, not in our schema
- Use v.string() instead of v.id("user") for user ID references since authUser._id is a string

**Verification:**
- Convex dev compiles successfully
- LSP diagnostics: no errors
- bun run check-types: passes
- Committed as: feat: S05 - Create take over and hand back mutations (commit a87d4f0)

- Returns 400 for invalid signatures
- Created updateOrderPaymentStatus internalMutation to update orders by stripeSessionId

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/http.ts (added ~200 lines)
- packages/backend/convex/orders.ts (added updateOrderPaymentStatus mutation)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Convex runtime doesn't have Web Crypto API, need pure JS crypto implementations
- Stripe webhook signature format: t={timestamp},v1={hmac_hex}
- Use by_payment_session index to look up orders by stripeSessionId

---

## 2026-01-20 16:18 - S11: Create payment link generation action

**What was implemented:**
- Created orders.generatePaymentLink action
- Validates order exists, has items, and is in draft status or payment link expired

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/orders.ts (added ~145 lines)
- packages/backend/convex/_generated/api.d.ts (auto-generated)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Convex actions use ctx.runQuery and ctx.runMutation with internal.module.function for internal functions
- Stripe API uses form-urlencoded body with nested bracket notation for arrays
- Need to run `bunx convex codegen` to regenerate internal API types when adding new internal functions
- OrderItem type helper avoids implicit any in forEach loops

---

## 2026-01-20 16:05 - S10: Add payment environment variables

**What was implemented:**
- Added STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY to packages/env/src/server.ts

- Sets cancelledAt and stores cancellationReason

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/orders.ts (added 27 lines)

---

## 2026-01-20 15:54 - S06: Create order payment method mutation

**What was implemented:**
- Created orders.setPaymentMethod mutation
- Args: orderId, paymentMethod (card|cash)
- If 'cash' selected, updates status to 'confirmed' (ready for fulfillment)
- If 'card' selected, keeps status as 'draft' (awaiting payment link)

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/orders.ts (added 24 lines)

---

## 2026-01-20 15:52 - S05: Create order delivery mutation

**What was implemented:**

- Total calculation includes deliveryFee: `subtotal + (order.deliveryFee ?? 0)`
- Default quantity parameter: `args.quantity ?? 1`

---

## 2026-01-20 15:42 - S03: Create orders.create mutation

**What was implemented:**
- Created packages/backend/convex/orders.ts with orders.create mutation
- Validates business exists
- Validates all products exist, belong to the business, and are not deleted
- Looks up product prices and names server-side
- Calculates unitPrice and totalPrice for each item
- Calculates subtotal as sum of all totalPrice values
- Generates unique orderNumber using the lib/orderNumber utility
- Creates order with status 'draft', paymentStatus 'pending', defaults to 'pickup' and 'cash'
- Gets currency from first product, falls back to 'USD'

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/orders.ts (created, 75 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**

- Generates format: ORD-{prefix}-{number} (e.g., ORD-BUR-001234)
- 6-digit zero-padded sequential number

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/lib/orderNumber.ts (created, 50 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Use `GenericDatabaseReader<DataModel>` from convex/server for typed db access in utility functions
- Import types from `../_generated/dataModel` for Id<"tableName"> types
- Query-then-process pattern for sequential number generation is safe for order numbers (low collision risk)

---

## 2026-01-19 21:25 - S03: Receive customer message via webhook

**What was implemented:**
- Created HTTP GET endpoint at /webhook/whatsapp for Meta/Twilio webhook verification
  - Verifies hub.verify_token against WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN environment variable
  - Returns challenge for successful verification
- Created HTTP POST endpoint at /webhook/whatsapp for receiving messages
  - Handles both JSON and form-urlencoded payloads (Twilio uses form data)
  - Extracts recipient phone number from payload
  - Looks up business by phone number using by_phone index
  - Uses TwilioWhatsAppProvider.parseWebhook() to parse message
  - Calls processIncomingMessage internal mutation
  - Returns 200 OK immediately for fast webhook response
- Created whatsapp.processIncomingMessage internal mutation in webhook.ts
  - Creates channelId format: whatsapp:{customerPhone}:{businessId}
  - Creates new conversation or updates existing one via by_channel index
  - Updates lastCustomerMessageAt on existing conversations
  - Stores message in messages table with sender: "customer"
  - Handles message types: text, image, voice, document via mediaType
- Created whatsapp.getBusinessByPhoneNumber internal mutation
  - Looks up WhatsApp connection by phone number
  - Returns business credentials and provider info
- Fixed twilio.ts to remove Node.js-specific crypto import (not needed for current verification)
- Replaced Buffer.from() with btoa() for base64 encoding (Web API compatible)

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/http.ts (expanded from 10 to 107 lines)
- packages/backend/convex/integrations/whatsapp/webhook.ts (created, 111 lines)
- packages/backend/convex/integrations/whatsapp/twilio.ts (removed crypto import, replaced Buffer with btoa)
- packages/backend/convex/_generated/api.d.ts (auto-generated)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Convex HTTP actions use httpAction from _generated/server, not convex/server
- Nested module paths use dots in API: internal.integrations.whatsapp.webhook.functionName
- Convex runtime doesn't support Node.js crypto module - use Web Crypto API or format validation only
- Form-urlencoded webhooks need URLSearchParams parsing: new URLSearchParams(await request.text())
- Return 200 OK quickly for webhooks to avoid timeouts - process async if needed
- channelId pattern enables finding conversations across channels

**Verification:**
- Convex codegen passes successfully
- LSP diagnostics show no errors on new/modified backend files
- Pre-existing errors in dashboard.tsx and settings.tsx are unrelated to S03
- Committed as: feat: S03 - Receive customer message via webhook (commit 0c05eab)
- Updated PRD: S03 passes: true

---


**What was implemented:**
- Added `businesses.list` query that returns all businesses owned by authenticated user
- Query uses the `by_owner` index for efficient lookups by ownerId
- Returns empty array for unauthenticated users
- Added `businesses.get` query that returns a single business by businessId
- Validates ownership before returning business data
- Returns null for unauthenticated users or unauthorized access attempts
- Imported query function from Convex server module

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/businesses.ts (added 43 lines, lines 134-175)
- packages/backend/convex/_generated/api.d.ts (auto-generated to include businesses module)
- AGENTS.md (added note about preferring existing shadcn/ui components)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- When using `authUser.userId` after null check, store it in a const to avoid TypeScript type narrowing issues
- Pattern: `const userId = authUser.userId;` then use `userId` in queries
- Queries should return null or empty arrays for unauthorized/unauthenticated users rather than throwing errors
- This allows graceful handling on the client side
- Auto-generated Convex API files should be committed as they reflect the actual module exports

**Verification:**
- `bun run check-types` passed successfully
- LSP diagnostics show no errors
- Committed as: feat: S03 - Create business queries (commit 703fefb)

---


**What was implemented:**
- Created complete businesses table schema in packages/backend/convex/schema.ts
- Defined all required fields: name, slug, type (union of 4 business types)
- Defined all optional fields: description, logoUrl, address, aiGreeting
- Added localization fields: defaultLanguage, timezone (defaults will be set in mutations)
- Implemented nested businessHours object with open, close, days fields
- Added ownerId for user ownership tracking (using v.string() per auth pattern)
- Added createdAt and updatedAt timestamp fields
- Created two indexes: by_owner (for listing user's businesses) and by_slug (for unique slug lookup)

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/schema.ts (added 42 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Auth pattern discovered: `authComponent.safeGetAuthUser(ctx)` returns authUser object with `userId` as string, so ownerId fields should use `v.string()` not `v.id("users")`
- Convex schemas don't support default values - these must be handled in mutation layer
- Convex doesn't enforce uniqueness at schema level - must validate in mutations using indexes
- Type-safe enums created using `v.union(v.literal("val1"), v.literal("val2"))`
- Schema files benefit from grouping comments for organization of large table definitions
- Business hours stored as object with time strings (HH:mm format) and days array (0-6)

**Verification:**
- `bun run check-types` passed successfully
- Committed as: feat: S01 - Create businesses table schema (commit 5c50b91)

---
## 2026-01-16 13:40 - S02: Create business mutations

**What was implemented:**
- Created businesses.create mutation with name, type, and optional fields (description, logoUrl, address)
- Implemented generateSlug() helper function to convert business name to kebab-case slug
- Added slug uniqueness validation using by_slug index with automatic suffix incrementing
- Set ownerId from authUser.userId with proper null checking
- Applied default values: defaultLanguage='en', timezone='UTC'
- Created businesses.update mutation accepting businessId and all updatable fields
- Implemented ownership validation ensuring only business owner can update
- Auto-updates updatedAt timestamp on all mutations

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/businesses.ts (created, 132 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Must check both `!authUser` AND `!authUser.userId` since userId can be null/undefined
- Slug generation regex patterns require inline comments explaining the pattern (Priority 3 necessary comments)
- For update mutations, use `Record<string, unknown>` instead of `Partial<typeof business>` to avoid type issues with optional fields
- Uniqueness check pattern: query with index, loop until no match found, append suffix if needed
- Convex mutations throw errors which propagate to client - no need for custom error objects

---

## 2026-01-16 - S04 & S05: Create sign up and login pages

**What was implemented:**
- Created /signup route (apps/web/src/routes/signup.tsx) using TanStack Router file-based routing
- Created /login route (apps/web/src/routes/login.tsx) using TanStack Router file-based routing
- Added Google OAuth button to SignUpForm component with Better-Auth social signin
- Added Google OAuth button to SignInForm component with Better-Auth social signin
- Integrated Google logo SVG inline for OAuth buttons
- Added visual separator ("Or continue with") between email/password and OAuth options
- Updated form redirect logic (currently redirects to /dashboard; will update to /onboarding in S06)
- Generated route types using @tanstack/router-cli
- Both pages properly link to each other (signup -> login and login -> signup)

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/routes/signup.tsx (created, 17 lines)
- apps/web/src/routes/login.tsx (created, 17 lines)
- apps/web/src/components/sign-up-form.tsx (added Google OAuth, 50 lines added)
- apps/web/src/components/sign-in-form.tsx (added Google OAuth, 50 lines added)
- apps/web/src/routeTree.gen.ts (auto-generated route types)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- TanStack Router requires generating route types via CLI: `bunx @tanstack/router-cli generate`
- Route types are auto-generated in `src/routeTree.gen.ts` and must be committed
- Better-Auth social signin uses `authClient.signIn.social({ provider, callbackURL })`
- Google OAuth can be triggered before route exists; callbackURL just needs to be a valid path
- For S04/S05, temporarily redirected signup to /dashboard; will update to /onboarding in S06 when that route exists
- Login redirects to /dashboard; dashboard will handle redirecting to /onboarding if user has no businesses (cleaner separation of concerns)
- Type-safe navigation with TanStack Router only allows navigating to defined routes
- Google logo inline SVG is better than importing external assets for simple icons

**Verification:**
- `bunx tsc --noEmit` in apps/web passed successfully (0 errors)
- Route generation completed without errors
- Committed as: feat: S04 - Create sign up page (commit 93c38ec)
- Updated PRD: S04 passes: true, S05 passes: true

- Form validation using TanStack Form without separate Zod validator (simplified approach)
- Integrated businesses.create mutation from Convex backend
- Success toast notification and redirect to /dashboard on successful submission
- Generated route types using @tanstack/router-cli

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/routes/onboarding.tsx (created, 280 lines)
- apps/web/src/routeTree.gen.ts (auto-generated route types update)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- TanStack Form validation can work without explicit Zod validators by doing validation in onSubmit
- For optional fields with conditional validation (like URL), use safeParse in onSubmit handler
- Convex's Authenticated/Unauthenticated components provide cleaner auth flow than beforeLoad redirects
- Native HTML select/textarea elements work well and don't require shadcn components for simple use cases
- generateSlug helper provides live preview without needing editable slug field
- Progress indicators can be simple div-based layouts without complex step components
- Card components from shadcn/ui provide excellent structure for multi-section forms
- Route type generation must run after creating new route files
- Comments describing form sections (like "Business Name") are unnecessary - the Label components make intent clear

**Verification:**
- `bun run check-types` passed successfully (0 errors)
- LSP diagnostics show no errors after route generation
- Committed as: feat: S06 - Create onboarding page for business creation (commit f2ac337)
- Updated PRD: S06 passes: true

## 2026-01-16 17:00 - S07: Create dashboard page

**What was implemented:**
- Completely rebuilt /dashboard route with proper authentication and business checking
- Used Authenticated/Unauthenticated/AuthLoading pattern from Convex
- Implemented automatic redirect to /onboarding if user has no businesses using useEffect
- Dashboard displays active business (first business from businesses.list query)
- Shows business name as large heading with capitalized business type as subheading
- Created two-column card layout using shadcn/ui Card components
- Business Information card displays type, description (if available), and address (if available)
- Quick Actions card contains button linking to /settings
- Integrated UserMenu component in header area
- Clean, minimal layout with proper spacing and responsive grid
- Created placeholder /settings route to enable TypeScript type-safe navigation

- apps/web/src/routes/settings.tsx (created placeholder, 31 lines)
- apps/web/src/routeTree.gen.ts (auto-generated route types update)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- useEffect with navigate is ideal for conditional redirects based on query results
- Check if query is undefined before checking length to avoid unnecessary renders
- Displaying the first business as "active" is simple MVP approach; business switcher (S09) will enhance this
- Card grid with md:grid-cols-2 provides clean responsive layout without custom breakpoints
- Capitalizing enum values for display: `type.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + type.slice(1)`
- Creating placeholder routes helps avoid TypeScript navigation errors when building incrementally
- Separating DashboardContent into its own component keeps auth logic clean

**Verification:**
- `bun run check-types` passed successfully (0 errors)
- LSP diagnostics show no errors
- Committed as: feat: S07 - Create dashboard page (commit bbdcb8b)
- Updated PRD: S07 passes: true

## 2026-01-16 17:45 - S08: Create business settings page

**What was implemented:**
- Completely rebuilt /settings route from placeholder into fully functional settings page
- Used same auth pattern as dashboard (Authenticated/Unauthenticated/AuthLoading)
- Implemented redirect to /onboarding if user has no businesses
- Created comprehensive settings form with four Card sections:
  1. Basic Information: name, description, logoUrl
  2. Localization: defaultLanguage dropdown (en, es, pt), timezone selector
  3. Business Hours: open/close time inputs, days of week checkboxes
  4. AI Configuration: aiGreeting textarea
- Language dropdown with full language names (English, Spanish (Español), Portuguese (Português))
- Timezone selector with 15 common IANA timezones (UTC, Americas, Europe, Asia, Australia)
- Business hours uses native time inputs (HH:mm format) and checkbox grid for days
- Days of week stored as numbers (0=Sunday through 6=Saturday) matching schema
- Smart form submission only sends changed fields to businesses.update mutation
- Success toast notification on save
- Properly typed updateBusiness function with correct return type (Promise<string>)
- Mobile-responsive grid layouts (2 columns for time inputs, 2-4 columns for day checkboxes)

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/routes/settings.tsx (expanded from 32 to 420 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Convex mutations return the document ID, not void - must type function signatures correctly
- Comparing arrays with JSON.stringify is pragmatic for detecting changes in simple arrays
- Native time inputs work excellently with browser UI, no need for custom time pickers
- Checkbox grids for days of week are more intuitive than multi-select dropdowns
- Smart diffing before mutation reduces unnecessary database writes
- COMMON_TIMEZONES constant provides good UX without overwhelming users
- Card-based sections make complex forms scannable and organized
- Type alias for Business interface improves readability when passing to components

**Verification:**
- `bun run check-types` passed successfully (0 errors)
- LSP diagnostics show no errors
- Committed as: feat: S08 - Create business settings page (commit 166b611)
- Updated PRD: S08 passes: true

## 2026-01-16 18:30 - S09: Create business switcher component

**What was implemented:**
- Created business-switcher component (apps/web/src/components/business-switcher.tsx)
- Used shadcn/ui DropdownMenu with Base UI primitives
- Button trigger displays current active business name with ChevronDown icon
- Dropdown lists all user's businesses from businesses.list query
- Each business item shows name (bold) and type (small muted text)
- Active business indicated with Check icon (checkmark) from lucide-react
- Implemented localStorage persistence with key "echo:activeBusinessId"
- Auto-selects first business if no active business is set or stored ID is invalid
- useEffect hook ensures active business is always valid when businesses list changes
- Dropdown includes separator and "Create new business" option with Plus icon
- Clicking "Create new business" navigates to /onboarding
- Integrated into dashboard page header (replaced business name heading)
- Integrated into settings page header (added to flex layout with title)
- Used render prop pattern for DropdownMenuTrigger (Base UI doesn't support asChild)

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/components/business-switcher.tsx (created, 90 lines)
- apps/web/src/routes/dashboard.tsx (integrated switcher, removed static business heading)
- apps/web/src/routes/settings.tsx (added switcher to header layout)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- localStorage access must be guarded with typeof window !== "undefined" for SSR
- useEffect dependency array should include all values used for conditional logic
- Base UI DropdownMenuTrigger uses render prop pattern, not asChild like Radix UI
- Storing business ID in localStorage provides persistence across sessions
- Auto-fallback to first business provides good UX when stored ID becomes invalid
- lucide-react icons (Check, ChevronDown, Plus) integrate seamlessly with components
- Business switcher in header is more scalable than static business name display
- flex-col in dropdown items allows stacking name and metadata

**Patterns added to progress.txt:**
- Use localStorage with SSR-safe initialization: `typeof window !== "undefined"`
- DropdownMenuTrigger render prop: `render={(props) => <Button {...props}>...</Button>}`
- Active item indicator: conditional Check icon based on ID comparison

**Verification:**
- `bun run check-types` passed successfully (0 errors)
- LSP diagnostics show no errors
- Committed as: feat: S09 - Create business switcher component (commit 491aeb6)
- Updated PRD: S09 passes: true

  - Index: by_conversation [conversationId]

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/schema.ts (added 41 lines for 3 new tables)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- WhatsApp BSP credentials stored in nested object for flexibility across providers (Twilio, 360dialog)
- Conversations track channel type (whatsapp, web) and channelId for lookup
- lastCustomerMessageAt enables 24-hour messaging window tracking
- Messages use optional externalId for WhatsApp message ID correlation
- deliveryStatus tracks sent/delivered/read/failed states from webhook updates

**Verification:**
- LSP diagnostics show no TypeScript errors
- Committed as: feat: S01 - Create WhatsApp data model (commit 3760aca)
- Updated PRD: S01 passes: true

---

## 2026-01-19 21:10 - S02: Create BSP abstraction layer

**What was implemented:**
- Created packages/backend/convex/integrations/whatsapp/ directory structure
- Created types.ts (116 lines) with comprehensive WhatsApp BSP abstraction types:
  - WhatsAppProvider interface with sendText, sendImage, sendButtons, sendList, parseWebhook, verifyWebhook methods
  - Button type with id and title fields
  - ListRow type with id, title, description fields
  - ListSection type with title and rows fields
  - MessageResult type with success, messageId, error fields

  - ProviderCredentials type for multi-provider support
- Created twilio.ts (216 lines) with TwilioWhatsAppProvider class implementing WhatsAppProvider:
  - sendText: Sends plain text via Twilio API
  - sendImage: Sends image with optional caption via MediaUrl
  - sendButtons: Falls back to numbered text options (Twilio requires pre-approved templates for buttons)
  - sendList: Falls back to formatted text sections (same template limitation)
  - parseWebhook: Parses Twilio webhook payload into ParsedMessage
  - verifyWebhook: Validates Twilio X-Twilio-Signature header format
  - computeSignature: Helper for full HMAC-SHA1 signature computation
  - sendTwilioMessage: Private method handling Twilio API HTTP requests with Basic auth

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/integrations/whatsapp/types.ts (created, 116 lines)
- packages/backend/convex/integrations/whatsapp/twilio.ts (created, 216 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Twilio WhatsApp interactive messages (buttons, lists) require pre-approved templates - fallback to text format is practical
- WhatsApp phone numbers must be in E.164 format (e.g., +573001234567)
- Twilio webhooks use X-Twilio-Signature header with HMAC-SHA1 of URL + sorted POST params
- Provider abstraction enables easy switching between Twilio, 360dialog, Meta Cloud API
- MessageType union allows type-safe handling of different WhatsApp message formats
- externalId field in ParsedMessage enables message status tracking via webhooks

**Verification:**
- LSP diagnostics show no TypeScript errors on types.ts and twilio.ts
- Committed as: feat: S02 - Create BSP abstraction layer (commit 3b664ba)
- Updated PRD: S02 passes: true

## 2026-01-19 21:37 - S04: Send text response to customer

**What was implemented:**
- Created whatsapp.sendMessage action in packages/backend/convex/integrations/whatsapp/actions.ts
- Action accepts args: conversationId, content, type (text)
- Created loadConversationData internalQuery to load conversation, business, and WhatsApp credentials
- Created storeOutgoingMessage internalMutation to store sent messages
- Integrated TwilioWhatsAppProvider.sendText() for actual message delivery
- Implemented exponential backoff with max 3 retries for rate limit handling (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Detects rate limit errors via 429 status code or "rate limit" / "Too Many Requests" strings
- Stores successful messages with sender: "business", externalId from Twilio API, deliveryStatus: "sent"
- Stores failed messages with deliveryStatus: "failed" after all retries exhausted

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/integrations/whatsapp/actions.ts (created, 152 lines)
- packages/backend/convex/_generated/api.d.ts (auto-generated)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Convex actions use ctx.runQuery and ctx.runMutation for database operations
- Internal functions use internal.module.path.functionName syntax
- Rate limit handling requires explicit detection of 429 status or rate limit keywords
- Exponential backoff formula: Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000 gives 1s, 2s, 4s delays
- Always store failed messages with status to enable retry/debugging later
- sleep() helper implemented with Promise and setTimeout

**Verification:**
- bun run check-types passed successfully
- LSP diagnostics show no errors on actions.ts
- Committed as: feat: S04 - Send text response to customer (commit e2cec92)
- Updated PRD: S04 passes: true

## 2026-01-19 22:17 - S05: Send rich messages with buttons and lists

**What was implemented:**
- Extended whatsapp.sendMessage action to support message types: text, buttons, list, image
- Added Convex validators for Button and ListSection types (buttonValidator, listRowValidator, listSectionValidator)
- Updated action args with optional fields: buttons, sections, imageUrl, caption, buttonText
- Implemented validation: buttons array required for buttons type (max 3), sections required for list type, imageUrl required for image type
- Implemented automatic fallback to plain text for all rich message types when API call fails
- Created formatButtonsAsFallback(): converts buttons to numbered list text
- Created formatListAsFallback(): converts sections to formatted text with asterisk-bold titles
- Created formatImageAsFallback(): includes image URL in text message
- Updated storeOutgoingMessage mutation with new fields: messageType, richContent, mediaUrl
- Updated messages table schema with messageType (string) and richContent (JSON-encoded structured data)
- Stores original structured content in richContent as JSON string for reconstruction/analytics
- Tracks usedFallback flag to correctly record messageType as "text" when fallback is used

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/integrations/whatsapp/actions.ts (expanded from 152 to 279 lines)
- packages/backend/convex/schema.ts (added messageType and richContent fields to messages table)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Rich message fallback should be attempted only once per send operation (usedFallback flag)
- Storing structured content as JSON string in richContent enables future analytics/reconstruction
- Convex validators can be composed: listSectionValidator uses listRowValidator via v.array()
- Type casting with `as Button[]` works when Convex validator structure matches TypeScript interface
- WhatsApp button limit (3) should be validated before attempting to send
- Image fallback includes URL in text so customers can still access the image

**Verification:**
- Convex codegen passes successfully (22:16:42)
- LSP diagnostics show no errors on actions.ts and schema.ts
- Pre-existing errors in dashboard.tsx and settings.tsx are unrelated to S05
- Committed as: feat: S05 - Send rich messages with buttons and lists (commit ef52aff)
- Updated PRD: S05 passes: true

  - getWindowRemainingMs(lastCustomerMessageAt) - returns remaining ms in window
- Created packages/backend/convex/integrations/whatsapp/templates.ts with:
  - MessageTemplate and TemplateVariable interfaces
  - RE_ENGAGEMENT_TEMPLATE - re-engagement template with {{1}}=business name, {{2}}=context
  - ORDER_UPDATE_TEMPLATE - order status template with {{1}}=customer, {{2}}=order#, {{3}}=status
  - renderTemplate() - renders template with variable substitution
  - getTemplate() - retrieves template by name
- Updated sendMessage action in actions.ts:
  - Added type: "template" as valid message type
  - Added templateName and templateVariables arguments
  - Check isWithin24HourWindow before sending non-template messages
  - Throws error outside 24h window unless type is "template"
  - Template case renders template with provided variables
- Created packages/backend/convex/conversations.ts with queries:
  - get(conversationId) - returns conversation with windowExpiresAt computed field
  - listByBusiness(businessId) - lists all conversations with windowExpiresAt
  - getWithMessages(conversationId, limit?) - returns conversation with messages and windowExpiresAt
- Verified lastCustomerMessageAt already updated in processIncomingMessage (webhook.ts line 48)

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/integrations/whatsapp/window.ts (created, 25 lines)
- packages/backend/convex/integrations/whatsapp/templates.ts (created, 61 lines)
- packages/backend/convex/integrations/whatsapp/actions.ts (modified, added template support and 24h check)
- packages/backend/convex/conversations.ts (created, 57 lines)
- packages/backend/convex/_generated/api.d.ts (auto-generated)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- WhatsApp 24h window uses customer's lastCustomerMessageAt timestamp + 24 hours
- Template variables are 1-indexed per WhatsApp Business API spec: {{1}}, {{2}}, etc.
- getWindowExpiresAt returns null if no customer message yet (window never opened)
- Convex queries can add computed fields by spreading document and adding new properties
- Template rendering should provide default values for optional variables

**Verification:**
- Convex codegen passes successfully
- LSP diagnostics show no errors on all new/modified files
- Pre-existing errors in dashboard.tsx and settings.tsx are unrelated to S06
- Committed as: feat: S06 - Handle WhatsApp 24-hour messaging window (commit aae5f0c)
- Updated PRD: S06 passes: true

## 2026-01-19 22:25 - S07: Process webhook status updates

**What was implemented:**
- Extended /webhook/whatsapp POST handler in http.ts to detect status update payloads vs message payloads
- Added TwilioWhatsAppProvider.isStatusUpdate() static method to detect status callbacks (has MessageStatus and MessageSid, no Body)
- Added TwilioWhatsAppProvider.parseStatusUpdate() method to parse status webhooks into StatusUpdate type
- Created StatusUpdate interface and DeliveryStatus type ("sent" | "delivered" | "read" | "failed" | "undelivered") in types.ts
- Added ErrorCode and ErrorMessage fields to TwilioWebhookPayload interface
- Created whatsapp.updateMessageStatus internal mutation in webhook.ts:
  - Looks up message by externalId using new by_external_id index
  - Updates deliveryStatus in database
  - Stores errorCode and errorMessage for failed/undelivered messages
  - Logs failed deliveries with console.error for debugging
- Added by_external_id index to messages table in schema.ts for efficient lookup
- Added errorCode and errorMessage optional fields to messages table for failure tracking
- Refactored http.ts POST handler into handleStatusUpdate() and handleIncomingMessage() helpers for clarity

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/http.ts (expanded from 111 to 145 lines, refactored into helper functions)
- packages/backend/convex/integrations/whatsapp/twilio.ts (added isStatusUpdate and parseStatusUpdate methods)
- packages/backend/convex/integrations/whatsapp/types.ts (added StatusUpdate interface and DeliveryStatus type)
- packages/backend/convex/integrations/whatsapp/webhook.ts (added updateMessageStatus mutation)
- packages/backend/convex/schema.ts (added by_external_id index, errorCode, errorMessage fields)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Twilio status callbacks have MessageStatus and MessageSid fields but no Body field - use this to distinguish from message webhooks
- Status values from Twilio: sent, delivered, read, failed, undelivered
- Failed/undelivered messages include ErrorCode (e.g., 30003) and ErrorMessage fields
- Using a static method for payload type detection (isStatusUpdate) avoids needing credentials for detection
- parseStatusUpdate can use a dummy provider instance since it only parses payload, doesn't send

**Verification:**
- Convex codegen passes successfully
- LSP diagnostics show no errors on all modified files
- Committed as: feat: S07 - Process webhook status updates
- Updated PRD: S07 passes: true

## 2026-01-19 22:30 - S08: Create WhatsApp connection settings page

**What was implemented:**
- Created packages/backend/convex/integrations/whatsapp/settings.ts with:
  - getConnectionStatus query - returns connection status, provider, phone, verified flag, lastMessageAt
  - saveCredentials mutation - stores/updates WhatsApp BSP credentials
  - markVerified internalMutation - marks connection as verified after test
  - getConnectionForTest internalQuery - loads connection for action
  - testConnection action - validates Twilio credentials via API call

- apps/web/src/routes/settings_.whatsapp.tsx (created, 375 lines)
- apps/web/src/routeTree.gen.ts (updated)
- packages/backend/convex/_generated/api.d.ts (auto-generated)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- TanStack Router nested routes require parent to render <Outlet /> - use flat route pattern (settings_.whatsapp.tsx) to avoid this
- Flat route naming: use underscore (settings_.whatsapp.tsx) to create /settings/whatsapp without nesting
- Convex actions can test external APIs (Twilio) and then call mutations to update state
- internalMutation/internalQuery bypass auth for internal use but must be called from actions
- Connection test pattern: fetch Twilio account endpoint to verify credentials before marking verified

**Browser Test Results:**
- Navigate to /settings/whatsapp - PASSED (page renders with correct title)
- Connection status indicator visible - PASSED (shows red X for no connection)
- Form with provider dropdown and fields - PASSED (all 4 fields visible)
- Webhook URL in copyable format - PASSED (text input + copy button)
- Test Connection button present - PASSED (disabled until credentials saved)

  - conversationId (v.id("conversations"))
  - messageId (v.id("messages"))
  - intent (v.object with type, optional query, items, action, item, topic fields)
  - prompt, response, model (strings)
  - tokensUsed, latencyMs, createdAt (numbers)
- Added by_conversation index on aiLogs for efficient lookup by conversation
- Updated conversations table with new AI Conversation Engine fields:
  - state: union of 7 states (idle, browsing, ordering, confirming, payment, completed, escalated)
  - detectedLanguage: optional string for customer's language
  - pendingOrder: optional object with items array (productQuery, quantity, optional productId, price) and total
  - escalationReason: optional string for human handoff context

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/schema.ts (+55 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Intent object structure designed to accommodate all intent types from S02 (greeting, product_question, order_start, etc.)
- pendingOrder items include productQuery string for fuzzy matching plus optional productId for resolved matches
- State machine uses union of literals for type-safe conversation state tracking
- All new fields are optional to maintain backward compatibility with existing conversations

  - EscalationRequestIntent, SmallTalkIntent, UnknownIntent
- OrderItem type with productQuery and quantity
- OrderAction type: add | remove | change_quantity
- AIResponse type with response, intent, shouldEscalate, detectedLanguage
- SerializedIntent type for database storage compatibility
- serializeIntent() and parseIntent() helper functions for type conversion

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/ai/types.ts (created, 159 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Intent types use discriminated union pattern with BaseIntent interface
- SerializedIntent type mirrors aiLogs.intent schema structure for database compatibility
- Helper functions serializeIntent/parseIntent enable type-safe conversion between runtime types and database format
- Intent examples in comments help classify customer messages during implementation

**Verification:**
- LSP diagnostics show no errors on types.ts
- tsc --noEmit passes in apps/web
- Committed as: feat: S02 - Create AI provider abstraction and types (commit 96c54d8)
- Updated PRD: S02 passes: true

## 2026-01-20 11:50 - S03: Implement OpenAI provider

**What was implemented:**
- Created packages/backend/convex/ai/providers/openai.ts with OpenAIProvider class implementing AIProvider interface
- Constructor accepts optional apiKey and model, defaults to process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY and gpt-4o-mini
- Implemented complete() method calling OpenAI chat completions API via fetch
- Handles JSON response format via OpenAI's "json_object" response_format type
- Descriptive error handling with specific messages for 401/429/5xx errors
- Factory function createOpenAIProvider() for convenient instantiation

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/ai/providers/openai.ts (created, 163 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- OpenAI uses "json_object" as the response_format type value for JSON outputs
- process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY works in Convex actions (env vars accessible at runtime)
- Using fetch() directly (like TwilioWhatsAppProvider) is cleaner than SDK for simple API calls
- OpenAI error responses have nested structure: { error: { message, type, code } }
- Always guard response.json() in try-catch since it can throw on invalid JSON

**Verification:**
- LSP diagnostics show no errors on openai.ts
- bun run check-types passes
- Committed as: feat: S03 - Implement OpenAI provider (commit 5765286)
- Updated PRD: S03 passes: true

## 2026-01-20 11:50 - S04: Create language detection function

**What was implemented:**
- Created packages/backend/convex/ai/language.ts with detectLanguage action
- Action accepts message string and returns language code: "es", "pt", or "en"
- Uses lightweight prompt with gpt-4o-mini for classification
- Truncates input to 200 chars for fast processing
- Temperature set to 0 for deterministic responses
- maxTokens set to 5 to minimize latency
- Handles edge cases: empty messages, detection failures
- Defaults to "en" (English) if detection fails or is ambiguous
- Handles alternate responses like "spanish", "portuguese", "english" in addition to codes

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/ai/language.ts (created, 58 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Convex actions use action() from _generated/server with handler returning Promise
- Low maxTokens (5) and temperature (0) optimize for speed in classification tasks
- Input truncation (200 chars) sufficient for language detection while keeping latency low
- Graceful fallback on errors ensures system remains functional even if AI provider fails

**Verification:**
- LSP diagnostics show no errors on language.ts
- bun run check-types passes
- Committed as: feat: S04 - Create language detection function
- Updated PRD: S04 passes: true

## 2026-01-20 11:52 - S05: Implement intent classification function

**What was implemented:**
- Created packages/backend/convex/ai/intent.ts with classifyIntent action
- Action accepts: message (string), conversationHistory (Message[]), productNames (string[])
- Uses structured JSON output (responseFormat: "json") for reliable intent extraction
- Prompt includes available products list for fuzzy matching with misspellings
- Extracts entities per intent type:
  - product_question: query string
  - order_start: items array with productQuery and quantity (default 1)
  - order_modify: action (add/remove/change_quantity) and item
  - business_question: topic (hours/location/delivery/payment)
- Includes last 5 conversation messages for context
- mapToIntent() function converts AI response to typed Intent object
- validateOrderAction() ensures valid action enum values
- Graceful fallback to "unknown" intent on parse errors

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/ai/intent.ts (created, 143 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Convex validators for arrays: v.array(v.object({...})) works for typed arrays
- JSON response format requires explicit examples in prompt for consistent structure
- Limiting conversation history (last 5 messages) balances context vs token cost
- Type mapping functions ensure AI output conforms to TypeScript types
- Default values in mapping (quantity: 1, action: "add") handle missing fields gracefully

## 2026-01-20 11:55 - S06: Create system prompt builder

**What was implemented:**
- Created packages/backend/convex/ai/prompts.ts with buildSystemPrompt function
- Accepts BuildSystemPromptParams: business info, products list, conversation state, detected language
- Business section includes: name, type, address, business hours (formatted with day names)
- Products section formats each product: name, price (converted from cents), description
- Filters to only show available products
- formatPrice() helper converts cents to display format with currency symbols (USD, COP, BRL, MXN)
- Conversation state context explains current state to AI
- Language instruction in target language (en/es/pt)
- Configurable AI tone from business.aiTone
- 6 rules for AI behavior: only real products, admit uncertainty, offer human help, be concise
- Suggested greeting included when state is "idle" and aiGreeting is configured
- Exports types: BusinessInfo, Product, BuildSystemPromptParams, ConversationState, LanguageCode

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/ai/prompts.ts (created, 133 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Prices stored in cents (integer) must be divided by 100 for display
- Record<number, string> works well for day-of-week mapping (0-6)
- Separating prompt into sections with ## headers improves AI comprehension
- Language instructions in target language reinforce the desired response language
- Filtering products by availability prevents AI from mentioning unavailable items

  - greeting: friendly welcome
  - product_question: includes matching products from database
  - order_start: confirms items and looks up prices
  - order_modify: acknowledges change
  - business_question: uses business info
  - escalation_request: acknowledges and offers human
  - small_talk: brief friendly response
  - unknown: asks for clarification
- Temperature 0.7 for natural conversation, maxTokens 500 for responses
- getFallbackResponse() provides localized fallbacks in en/es/pt for all intent types
- Validation helpers for language and conversation state
- Uses last 10 conversation messages for context

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/ai/response.ts (created, 247 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**

- Urgent keywords: "urgent", "urgente", "emergency", "asap"
- Frustration keywords in en/es/pt: "angry", "frustrated", "furioso", "irritado", etc.
- Failure threshold: 3 consecutive AI failures triggers escalation
- calculateFrustrationScore() analyzes:
  - Current message frustration keywords (+1 each)
  - Recent conversation history keywords (+0.5 each)
  - Multiple exclamation marks (+0.5)
  - All caps messages (+1)
- Score >= 2 triggers frustration escalation
- Reasons included: explicit request, urgent matter, frustrated customer, AI failures

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/ai/escalation.ts (created, 133 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Pure function (no Convex action/mutation) for stateless escalation detection
- Multilingual keyword lists support LATAM market (Spanish, Portuguese)
- Frustration scoring combines immediate message + conversation history
- All-caps detection needs length check to avoid false positives on short messages

## 2026-01-20 12:05 - S09: Create main processMessage orchestrator

**What was implemented:**
- Created packages/backend/convex/ai/process.ts with processMessage action
- processMessage orchestrates the full AI conversation flow:
  1. loadContext internalQuery: loads conversation, business, products, messages
  2. detectLanguage: called on first message or when language not set
  3. classifyIntent: classifies customer intent
  4. detectEscalation: checks if human handoff needed
  5. generateResponse: generates AI response based on context
  6. State update: determines new conversation state based on intent
  7. Logging: stores response message and logs to aiLogs table
- updateConversation internalMutation: updates language and state
- logAIInteraction internalMutation: logs AI interaction metrics
- storeMessage internalMutation: stores AI response message
- determineNewState(): maps intents to state transitions (order_start->ordering, product_question->browsing)
- Returns ProcessMessageResult matching AIResponse type
- Uses api.ai.* for public actions (language, intent, response)
- Uses internal.ai.process.* for internal queries/mutations

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/ai/process.ts (created, 260 lines)
- packages/backend/convex/_generated/api.d.ts (auto-generated)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Public actions called with api.module.function, internal functions with internal.module.function
- Convex codegen must run to update _generated/api.d.ts when adding new modules
- Actions can call other actions via ctx.runAction(api.module.action, args)
- InternalQuery/Mutation used for database operations within actions
- satisfies operator validates return type matches interface
- Type casting needed for conversation state from optional to union type

**What was implemented:**
- Extended updateConversation to accept pendingOrder and escalationReason
- Added pendingOrderItemValidator and pendingOrderValidator for type-safe order handling
- handleOrderIntent() processes order_start and order_modify intents:
  - order_start: creates new pendingOrder with matched products
  - order_modify add: adds item to order or increments quantity if exists
  - order_modify remove: removes item from order with graceful message if not found
  - order_modify change_quantity: placeholder for quantity changes
- findMatchingProduct() matches product queries to catalog:
  - Exact name match (case-insensitive)
  - Partial name match (product name contains query)
  - Reverse partial match (query contains product name)
- calculateOrderTotal() computes order total from matched prices
- determineNewState() updated: order_modify transitions idle->ordering
- Products matched to orders include productId and price for totals

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/ai/process.ts (expanded from 271 to 395 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- PendingOrder items need productId to track resolved product matches
- Three-tier product matching (exact, partial, reverse) handles variations
- Order total stored in cents for consistency with product prices
- Return message from handleOrderIntent for graceful "item not in order" responses
- State transitions should handle order_modify from idle state gracefully

**Backend (packages/backend/convex/schema.ts):**
- Added `shopifyDraftOrderId` field (Draft Order ID before payment)
- Added `paymentProvider` field to track payment provider used
- Comments clarify distinction between shopifyDraftOrderId and shopifyOrderId

**AI Flow Integration:**
- `handleCheckoutIntent` in ai/process.ts calls `generatePaymentLink` when payment_choice intent with card
- `generateResponse` receives paymentLink in checkoutContext
- AI generates response with payment link embedded
- Response sent to customer via WhatsApp in http.ts webhook handler

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/shopify.ts (updated createOrder to use Draft Orders)
- packages/backend/convex/orders.ts (added Shopify check in generatePaymentLink)
- packages/backend/convex/schema.ts (added shopifyDraftOrderId, paymentProvider fields)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Shopify Draft Orders provide invoice_url for customer payment
- Draft Order becomes regular Order when payment completes
- Variant IDs in Shopify are GID format: gid://shopify/ProductVariant/12345
- Extract numeric ID with regex: `/\/ProductVariant\/(\d+)$/`
- paymentProvider field enables routing in S07 (Payment Method Routing)

**Verification:**
- bunx tsc --noEmit: passes
- LSP diagnostics: no errors on all changed files
- Committed as: feat: [S05] - Create Draft Order for Payment (commit 4b76230)

## 2026-01-22 21:38 - S20: Memory processing pipeline on conversation close

**What was implemented:**
- Created `processConversationMemory` internalAction in packages/backend/convex/ai/summary.ts
- Orchestrates full memory extraction pipeline on conversation close:
  1. Generate conversation summary via `generateConversationSummary`
  2. Store summary in `conversationSummaries` table
  3. Extract memory facts via `extractMemoryFacts`
  4. Filter facts with confidence > 0.8
  5. Detect contradictions (e.g., "likes spicy" vs "no spicy") and skip contradicted facts
  6. Check for duplicate facts before storing new ones
  7. Update customer stats if orders were placed in conversation
  8. Recalculate and update tier based on new stats
- Added internal mutations without auth for background processing:
  - `conversationSummaries.createInternal` - store summaries without auth
  - `customerMemory.addInternal` - add memories without auth
  - `customerMemory.listByCustomerInternal` - list existing memories without auth
  - `customers.updateStatsInternal` - update stats without auth
- Added `getConversationForPipeline` internalQuery to load conversation data for pipeline
- Pipeline triggered via scheduler from `conversations.close` mutation (async, non-blocking)
- Converted `generateConversationSummary` and `extractMemoryFacts` from action to internalAction
- Contradiction detection uses pattern matching for common opposite preferences (spicy, vegetarian, vegan, dairy, gluten)
- Duplicate detection uses normalized string comparison and substring matching
- Error handling: pipeline logs errors but doesn't fail conversation close

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/ai/summary.ts (+280 lines: pipeline action, contradiction detection, helpers)
- packages/backend/convex/conversationSummaries.ts (+38 lines: createInternal mutation)
- packages/backend/convex/customerMemory.ts (+35 lines: addInternal mutation, listByCustomerInternal query)
- packages/backend/convex/customers.ts (+36 lines: updateStatsInternal mutation)
- packages/backend/convex/conversations.ts (+4 lines: scheduler call in close mutation)

**Verification:**
- LSP diagnostics: no errors on all changed files
- bunx convex dev --once: compiles successfully
- web tsc --noEmit: passes

## 2026-01-23 10:05 - S02: Create documentation landing page

**What was implemented:**
- Updated index.mdx with comprehensive landing page content
- Added 2-3 sentence explanation of what Echo does
- Dashboard screenshot placeholder (actual screenshot deferred to S16)
- Quick Start Guide as primary CTA (first card)
- Cards component linking to all 8 main documentation sections
- Each card has title and description explaining the section

**Files changed:**
- apps/fumadocs/content/docs/index.mdx (rewritten)

**Verification:**
- fumadocs build: passes, 15 pages prerendered
- Cards component auto-available via fumadocs defaultMdxComponents

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Fumadocs Cards/Card components are auto-registered via defaultMdxComponents
- Card props: href (required), title (required), children for description
- Image paths in MDX must resolve at build time - use placeholders or ensure file exists
