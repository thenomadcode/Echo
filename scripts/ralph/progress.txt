## Codebase Patterns
- Schema tables use `defineTable()` with `v` validators from "convex/values"
- Auth pattern: `authComponent.safeGetAuthUser(ctx)` returns authUser with `userId` property - always check `!authUser || !authUser.userId`
- After auth check, store userId in const: `const userId = authUser.userId;` to avoid TypeScript narrowing issues
- Owner references use `ownerId: v.string()` (not v.id) since authUser.userId is a string
- Timestamps stored as `v.number()` in UTC, populated with `Date.now()` in mutations
- Optional fields use `v.optional(v.type)` wrapper
- Enum-like fields use `v.union(v.literal("value1"), v.literal("value2"))`
- Indexes defined with `.index("indexName", ["field"])` chained after defineTable
- Nested objects use `v.object({ field: v.type })`
- Mutations use `Record<string, unknown>` for update objects to avoid optional field type conflicts
- Uniqueness validation: query by index in loop, append suffix if exists
- Queries return null/empty arrays for unauthorized access; mutations throw errors

## 2026-01-16 15:20 - S03: Create business queries

**What was implemented:**
- Added `businesses.list` query that returns all businesses owned by authenticated user
- Query uses the `by_owner` index for efficient lookups by ownerId
- Returns empty array for unauthenticated users
- Added `businesses.get` query that returns a single business by businessId
- Validates ownership before returning business data
- Returns null for unauthenticated users or unauthorized access attempts
- Imported query function from Convex server module

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/businesses.ts (added 43 lines, lines 134-175)
- packages/backend/convex/_generated/api.d.ts (auto-generated to include businesses module)
- AGENTS.md (added note about preferring existing shadcn/ui components)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- When using `authUser.userId` after null check, store it in a const to avoid TypeScript type narrowing issues
- Pattern: `const userId = authUser.userId;` then use `userId` in queries
- Queries should return null or empty arrays for unauthorized/unauthenticated users rather than throwing errors
- This allows graceful handling on the client side
- Auto-generated Convex API files should be committed as they reflect the actual module exports

**Verification:**
- `bun run check-types` passed successfully
- LSP diagnostics show no errors
- Committed as: feat: S03 - Create business queries (commit 703fefb)

**What was implemented:**
- Created complete businesses table schema in packages/backend/convex/schema.ts
- Defined all required fields: name, slug, type (union of 4 business types)
- Defined all optional fields: description, logoUrl, address, aiGreeting
- Added localization fields: defaultLanguage, timezone (defaults will be set in mutations)
- Implemented nested businessHours object with open, close, days fields
- Added ownerId for user ownership tracking (using v.string() per auth pattern)
- Added createdAt and updatedAt timestamp fields
- Created two indexes: by_owner (for listing user's businesses) and by_slug (for unique slug lookup)

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/schema.ts (added 42 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Auth pattern discovered: `authComponent.safeGetAuthUser(ctx)` returns authUser object with `userId` as string, so ownerId fields should use `v.string()` not `v.id("users")`
- Convex schemas don't support default values - these must be handled in mutation layer
- Convex doesn't enforce uniqueness at schema level - must validate in mutations using indexes
- Type-safe enums created using `v.union(v.literal("val1"), v.literal("val2"))`
- Schema files benefit from grouping comments for organization of large table definitions
- Business hours stored as object with time strings (HH:mm format) and days array (0-6)

**Verification:**
- `bun run check-types` passed successfully
- Committed as: feat: S01 - Create businesses table schema (commit 5c50b91)

## 2026-01-16 13:40 - S02: Create business mutations

**What was implemented:**
- Created businesses.create mutation with name, type, and optional fields (description, logoUrl, address)
- Implemented generateSlug() helper function to convert business name to kebab-case slug
- Added slug uniqueness validation using by_slug index with automatic suffix incrementing
- Set ownerId from authUser.userId with proper null checking
- Applied default values: defaultLanguage='en', timezone='UTC'
- Created businesses.update mutation accepting businessId and all updatable fields
- Implemented ownership validation ensuring only business owner can update
- Auto-updates updatedAt timestamp on all mutations

**Files changed:**
- packages/backend/convex/businesses.ts (created, 132 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Must check both `!authUser` AND `!authUser.userId` since userId can be null/undefined
- Slug generation regex patterns require inline comments explaining the pattern (Priority 3 necessary comments)
- For update mutations, use `Record<string, unknown>` instead of `Partial<typeof business>` to avoid type issues with optional fields
- Uniqueness check pattern: query with index, loop until no match found, append suffix if needed
- Convex mutations throw errors which propagate to client - no need for custom error objects

## 2026-01-16 - S04 & S05: Create sign up and login pages

**What was implemented:**
- Created /signup route (apps/web/src/routes/signup.tsx) using TanStack Router file-based routing
- Created /login route (apps/web/src/routes/login.tsx) using TanStack Router file-based routing
- Added Google OAuth button to SignUpForm component with Better-Auth social signin
- Added Google OAuth button to SignInForm component with Better-Auth social signin
- Integrated Google logo SVG inline for OAuth buttons
- Added visual separator ("Or continue with") between email/password and OAuth options
- Updated form redirect logic (currently redirects to /dashboard; will update to /onboarding in S06)
- Generated route types using @tanstack/router-cli
- Both pages properly link to each other (signup -> login and login -> signup)

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/routes/signup.tsx (created, 17 lines)
- apps/web/src/routes/login.tsx (created, 17 lines)
- apps/web/src/components/sign-up-form.tsx (added Google OAuth, 50 lines added)
- apps/web/src/components/sign-in-form.tsx (added Google OAuth, 50 lines added)
- apps/web/src/routeTree.gen.ts (auto-generated route types)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- TanStack Router requires generating route types via CLI: `bunx @tanstack/router-cli generate`
- Route types are auto-generated in `src/routeTree.gen.ts` and must be committed
- Better-Auth social signin uses `authClient.signIn.social({ provider, callbackURL })`
- Google OAuth can be triggered before route exists; callbackURL just needs to be a valid path
- For S04/S05, temporarily redirected signup to /dashboard; will update to /onboarding in S06 when that route exists
- Login redirects to /dashboard; dashboard will handle redirecting to /onboarding if user has no businesses (cleaner separation of concerns)
- Type-safe navigation with TanStack Router only allows navigating to defined routes
- Google logo inline SVG is better than importing external assets for simple icons

**Verification:**
- `bunx tsc --noEmit` in apps/web passed successfully (0 errors)
- Route generation completed without errors
- Committed as: feat: S04 - Create sign up page (commit 93c38ec)
- Updated PRD: S04 passes: true, S05 passes: true
